What is the purpose of the 'yield' keyword in Python?,To create a new list from an existing list,To create a generator that produces a sequence of values,"In Python, the 'yield' keyword is used to create a generator. A generator is a special type of function that produces a sequence of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets, as it allows for memory-efficient processing. By using 'yield', you can write a function that generates values on-the-fly, rather than storing them all in memory at once.",False
What is the difference between the '==' and 'is' operators in Python?,"The '==' operator checks for equality of values, while the 'is' operator checks for identity.","The '==' operator checks for equality of values, while the 'is' operator checks for identity.","In Python, the '==' operator checks for equality of values, whereas the 'is' operator checks for identity. This means that '==' can return True even if the values are not the same object, whereas 'is' will only return True if the values are the same object. For example, [1, 2] == [1, 2] returns True, but [1, 2] is [1, 2] returns False because they are two separate objects in memory.",True
What is the purpose of the 'try' block in a 'try-except' statement in Python?,To catch and handle exceptions,To execute a block of code that might potentially raise an exception,"In Python, the 'try' block is used to execute a block of code that might potentially raise an exception. This allows the programmer to anticipate and handle any potential errors that might occur during the execution of the code. The 'try' block is typically followed by a 'except' block, which is used to catch and handle any exceptions that are raised during the execution of the code.",False
